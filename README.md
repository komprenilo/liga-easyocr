Here is the Python interpreter generated by the above export command:
```
dist/export/python/virtualenvs/python-default/3.8.14/bin/python

For VSCode, a sample [.vscode/settings.json](.vscode/settings.json) with Python `3.8.14` is prepared for you.

For PyCharm, please click `PyCharm -> Preferences... -> Project: pants-minimal-lab -> Python Interpreter` to add the existing `Virtualenv Environment` and then select it.
